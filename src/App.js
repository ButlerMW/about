          Michael Butler always had a sense for adventure and learning. From a young age he enjoyed outdoor 
          activities and developed interests for natural sciences which later developed into all forms of 
          science and mathematics.  
      </p>
      <p class="bio">
          After Michael graduated high school, he attended the University of Idaho where he continued to 
          study various sciences such as geology, geography, mathematics, physics, soil sciences, chemistry 
          and biology. During this time, Michael started to develop another passion - learning new softwares. 
      </p>
      <p class="bio">
          After graduating, Michael obtained a position as a survey crewman for one of Idahoâ€™s best engineering firms. 
          Although he did not have any experience and did not know much about land surveying, Michael worked hard and 
          learned as much as he could and within less than three years became a Crew Chief and worked on both large and 
          small projects around the state of Idaho. 
          During his time as a land surveyor, Michael fell in love with the technologies and softwares, so much so that 
          he made the decision to move from land surveying and pursue the passion of software. Michael left his job and 
          attended Coding Dojo, Boise branch to learn as much as he could about coding languages, software, and web development.

      </p>
      <p class="bio">
          Michael graduated from Coding Dojo with flying colors and high praise from his fellow classmates and instructor. 
          Out of all the various things Michael has learned, one thing is clear; Michael can learn new things quickly and 
          efficiently. His dream now is to continue to grow and strengthen upon the experiences and skills learned to become 
          a member of the technology world.
